# R Markdown editing

*R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R.* 
  **An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code, like the document below.**
  
  ```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r} 
fastfood<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-09-04/fastfood_calories.csv")
```


```{r}
library(knitr)
```

```{r}

fastfood%>%head(10)
```


```{r}
knitr::kable(head(fastfood[1:10, 1:5]),"pipe")
```
